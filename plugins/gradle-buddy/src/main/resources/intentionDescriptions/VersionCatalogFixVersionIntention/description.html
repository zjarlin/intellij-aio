  Creates a dedicated version variable for the current artifact and updates the <code>version.ref</code> to point to it.
  <p>
    When a dependency references a shared or incorrect version variable (e.g., a global LTS version),
    this intention creates a new version entry named after the artifactId with the latest version from Maven Central,
    and updates the dependency to use it.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the version variable already exists, it simply updates the reference (idempotent).
